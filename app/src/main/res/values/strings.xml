        The Mantra has to be recited on a Rudhraksha mala and should be spoken in such a way that at least you can hear it. Shri Shiv Mahapuran is of the view that Rudhraksha does not give its full results without the use of proper mantras.
    </string>
    <string name="_rud_how_to_wear">
        The scared Rudhraksha that you have got is abhimantrit and empowered by Pankaj Khanna, so that it gives maximum results. This is ready to wear or can be kept in your place of worship and should be worn on a Monday morning before 7.30 a.m.
        \n\n
        To recharge it, you should take it off one week before Mahashivratri. Take a clean bowl and put the Rudraksha in it. Add Pure Desi Ghee in that bowl so that the Rudhraksha is properly immersed in it. Add some sandal wood powder, a bit of turmeric powder (Haldi) in that bowl. Leave it for a week’s time or more.
        \n\n
        Then on Mahashivratri day before 7.30 a.m. wash it with Ganga Jal mixed with saffron (kesar) and wear it after chanting the required mantra 108 times. Fasting on Mondays and Mahashivratri day will also be great help and improves the results from a Rudraksha.

    <string name="_rud_auth">
        The Mystic bead Rudhraksha is highly sacred to the Hindus of all castes / sects and regions. But as some of the Rudhraksha are very costly so some people out of greed try to tamper with the Rudhraksha so as to make them like a more costly member of the family.
        \n\n
        <b>Now, the question before the buyer is how he should check the authenticity of the Rudhraksha.</b>
        \n\n\n
        <b>1. EYE TEST:</b> Look at the bead all the mukhas / faces should look like joined lips and the partitions where the line is visible should be clear and look natural.
        \n\n
        <b>2. EYE GLASS:</b> Sometimes Rudhraksha are faked by removing the thorn like parts from one piece and then sticking it to another. This can be judged by a close examination by a 10x Lens.
        \n\n
        <b>3. WATER TEST:</b> Put the Rudhraksha in boiling water and let it remain there for 20 – 30 minutes. If some faces are tempered with them they shall come off as the glue – fevicol or the like will come off.
        \n\n
        <b>4. SCIENTIFIC TEST:</b> A botanical laboratory or a botanist can test a Rudhraksha and testify its originality. So, if in doubt take the Rudhraksha to a Botanical laboratory and know the facts.
    </string>
    <string name="_rud_faqs">
        <b>1. How can, this mystic power named Rudhraksha, be used by mankind for maximum benefit?</b>
        \n\n
        \tRudhraksha can either be worn in neck or it can be at a sacred place in house i.e., in the puja room or in front of God’s / Goddess’s idol or picture.
        \n\n
        <b>2. Should Rudhraksha be worn all the time?</b>
        \n\n
        \tIf one chooses to wear a Rudhraksha then he/she should wear it all the day and take off before going to bed. Then it should be worn again after the morning puja / prayers.
        \n\n
        <b>3. Can one eat non-vegetarian food and take alcohol if one is wearing Rudhraksha?</b>
        \n\n
        \tThough taking non-vegetarian food and alcohol is not recommended to keep the Sanchit Karma pure but the Shiva sect of Hindu religion of which Rudhraksha is a symbol – does not prohibit it. So, one can take non-vegetarian food and take alcohol while wearing Rudhraksha.
        \n\n
        <b>4. What is the greatest use of Rudhraksha?</b>
        \n\n
        \tRudhraksha beads regulate the blood pressure thus helping in controlling the thought process. This helps in Meditations which is the ultimate tool to realize the power of the inner self.
        \n\n
        <b>5. Does wearing Rudhraksha bring results?</b>
        \n\n
        \tThough one of the most sacred possessions of a Hindu – Rudhraksha does not lead to instant results but if worn over a period of time with complete faith and the required mantras are chanted regularly then the results promised by the Mahashiv Purana are surely achieved – this is what the sages say.
        \n\n
        <b>6. What is the cost of one Mukhi Round Rudhraksha?</b>
        \n\n
        \tOne Mukhi Round Rudhraksha, which is said to have extraordinary powers is often heard of but such a piece is not seen in trade – I have never come across such a piece which is original, though I am trading in them since 1987.
        \n\n
        <b>7. How else can we get the benefits of Rudhraksha?</b>
        \n\n
        \t(1) Rudhraksha can be kept in the place of worship.
        \n
        \t(2) One can dip seven beads of five Mukhi Rudhraksha in a glass of water and drink the water daily in the morning. This improves the blood circulation, gives one better concentration and the general nervous system in improved. The Rudhraksha beads have to be changed after every seven days.

    <string name="_rud_home">
    <b>Why Rudraksha - At the First Stage ?</b>\n\n\t
The human life is full of pain both on the physical as well as emotional level. Our ancient Rishis tried to search for cures for all ailments that effect us . These cures were in the form of Auyerveda , religion etc . But even with a healthy body and complete devotion to God man does not feel happy and to large extent all his efforts after fulfillment of basic bread and butter needs are aimed at searching for that happiness. He wanders in search of this happiness in Disco Thiks and nightclubs or else in Rishikesh or temples ………….. he tries to earn extraordinary money, be a leader but all this leaves a strange emptiness in him.
\n\n
Amid this position of turmoil Lord Shiva tells Goddess Parvati in Shiv Mahapuran that \" Now for the \' kalyan\' ( emancipation) of mankind I tell you about Rudraksha \" . Rudraksha , is said , to keep our blood pressure in a state of perfect equilibrium thus giving us tranquility and internal peace that helps us in achieving a level of emotional stability . Wearing of Rudraksha also helps us in meditation that is why ancient Rishis used to wear a number of Rudrakshas on their body in order to achieve the state of Samadhi easily and stay in it for a long duration.
\n\n
Rudrakshas help us in achieving a balance and improves our mental faculties .

<b>What is the Unique Advantage of Rudraksha ?
\n\n
How Pankaj Khanna\'s Rudraksha\'s different ?</b>
        \n\tPankaj Khanna has been in the trade of Rudrakshas since 1987. The Rudraksha sold by him are collected from deep jungles through the length and breadth of Himalayas . Once collected they are thoroughly checked for originality, quality and efficacy. After this they are stored in accordance with the dicta\'s of the scriptures . Before sending it to the customer Pankaj Khanna himself empowers it with mantras and then in the most pious way it is packed and then dispatched to the customer in a ready to wear form.
\n\n
<b>Who can wear Rudrakshas ?</b>\n\n\t
All human beings can wear a Rudraksha without any restriction of race or gender.
\n\n
<b>After buying the product - What is the process to wear it ?</b>
        \n\n\t
The scared Rudhraksha that you have got is abhimantrit and empowered by Pankaj Khanna, so that it gives maximum results. This is ready to wear or can be kept in your place of worship and should be worn on a Monday morning before 7.30 a.m.
\n\n
To recharge it, you should take it off one week before Mahashivratri. Take a clean bowl and put the Rudraksha in it. Add Pure Desi Ghee in that bowl so that the Rudhraksha is properly immersed in it. Add some sandal wood powder, a bit of turmeric powder (Haldi) in that bowl. Leave it for a week\'s time or more.
\n\n
Then on Mahashivratri day before 7.30 a.m. wash it with Ganga Jal mixed with saffron (kesar) and wear it after chanting the required mantra 108 times. Fasting on Mondays and Mahashivratri day will also be great help and improves the results from a Rudraksha.

    <string name="ittr_about">
        <b>Ittar</b>\n\n
The word ittar or attar is basically an Arabic word which means scent,this in turn has been derived from the Persian word Atr,meaning fragrance. Attar is a natural perfume oil derived from botanical sources. Most commonly these oils are taken from the botanical material through hydro or steam distillation. Oils can also be expressed by chemical means but generally natural perfumes which qualify as Ittar/Attars are distilled naturally. The oils obtained from the herbs flowers and wood are generally distilled into a wood base such as sandalwood and then aged. The aging period can last from one to ten years depending on the botanicals used and the results desired.
\n
These all-natural perfumes are highly concentrated and therefore are usually offered for sale in small quantities and have traditionally been offered in decorated crystal cut type bottles or small jeweled decanters. Attars/Ittars have been used in the entire Eastern world for thousands of years. These 100% pure and natural perfumes are free of alcohol and chemicals. Natural perfumes are affordable because they are so concentrated that a small bottle will last the user several weeks, if not months. Due to the purity and the nature of oils, there is very little chance of spoilage .
\n
Some of the first lovers of Attars/Ittars were the Mughal nobles of India. Jasmine ittar was the favorite perfume of the Nizams of the Hyderabad state. Traditionally in the Eastern world it was a customary practice of nobility to offer ittar to their guests at the time of their departure. The Attars/Ittars are traditionally given in ornate tiny crystal cut bottles called as itardans. This tradition of giving a scent to one\'s guests continues to this day in many parts of the Eastern world. Among Sufi worshipers the use of Attars/Ittars during meditation circles and dances is quite common.
